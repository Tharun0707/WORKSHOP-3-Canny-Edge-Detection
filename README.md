# Canny Edge Detection

This project demonstrates the Canny Edge Detection algorithmâ€”a popular edge detection technique in image processing. The code processes the input image (animal-fox.webp) and detects edges using the Canny method in Python.

## Features
- Implements Canny Edge Detection
- Works with sample image `animal-fox.webp`
- Jupyter Notebook interface (`main.ipynb`)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

### Install Requirements
If using pip, you can install the dependencies via:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Make sure you have all requirements installed.
2. Place your input image (e.g., `animal-fox.webp`) in the project folder.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in `main.ipynb` to run the edge detection.

## Credits
This project was developed for learning and demonstration purposes.
